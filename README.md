# Godot game engine seperated export templates
This repository only contains seperated export template binaries for **Linux only** in the releases tab.

## Why?
Godot only offers export templates as a large binary archive for different platforms, 
the seperated relaes are **editor** builds and can't be traditionally served (AFAIK) as runtime binaries 
for games using the Godot game engine.
